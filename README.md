# pokemon-game-v.0.1

Welcome, in this game user can play with computer as opponent.
User have to choose between attacks this game is under development so 
We have only 3 attacks as follows:
(1)fire
(2)water
(3)grass
(4)dodge

Fire can beat grass.
Grass can beat water.
Water can beat fire.

Every player gets defence point,attack point,and hp value.

So, if any attacker won against another normal win reduce 250 points of opponent.
And if any attacker choose dodge as attack his hp value reduce 400 for that particular round, but his defence value increase to 50
Which will help him for further rounds because now he lost 200 hp point if he loose again


This game is my first game and I am in learning phase any suggestions would be appreciated
Thanks!
